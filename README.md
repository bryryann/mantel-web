# MantelWeb - Minimal social media web application

This project is the frontend React application for the social media platform, built with Vite and TypeScript.
Originally started as a small school project, this application has grown into a more complete and capable social media platform. 

Implements core features you'd expect from a social app — authentication, posts, likes, follows, and friendships, to name a few.
